# Decisions

Numbered, newest last. Each says what was decided and why.

## D1 — New project from two (2026-11-12)
Baltic Drive takes the OpenStreetMap importer, tile format, road/building meshing, routing and map screen from Dead
Miles, and the world machinery (nested-LOD streaming, worker builds with frame budgets, moving origin) and water from
Thornwake. Thornwake's terrain sampler, biomes and hydrology are procedural and stay behind: the ground here is real.
Its `TileBuilder` calls that sampler directly, so the terrain tile builder is rewritten in the same layout (33×33 grid
per tile, skirts, level-0 collision in pieces) fed from map tiles.

## D2 — One projection for the whole Baltic loop
Lambert conformal conic on WGS84, standard parallels 53° and 67° N, centred 58° N 20° E
(`+proj=lcc +lat_1=53 +lat_2=67 +lat_0=58 +lon_0=20`). Scale error depends only on latitude and stays within about
±1 % from the Tatras (49° N) to North Cape (71° N), so distances and speeds are real to within a percent everywhere
and roads continue across borders with no seams. The earlier idea of a projection per tile or region would have meant
re-projecting at region edges; doubles plus the moving origin (D3) carry the 2,000+ km. Grid north differs from true
north by up to ~10° at the far east and west; `Projection.Convergence` gives the correction for the compass.

## D3 — Moving origin
World positions are doubles; the scene holds float offsets from an origin that jumps (snapped to 1,024 m) when the
focus is 2 km away. Streamed nodes are anchored (`WorldOrigin.Anchor`) and repositioned on a jump; the car warps
keeping its velocity. Shaders get `world_offset` = origin mod 65,536 m so procedural patterns stay on the ground.

## D4 — Real elevation, smoothed road profiles
Poland: GUGiK NMT (bare ground, 1 m source) resampled to 10 m through its WCS. Copernicus GLO-30 would be global but is a
surface model: forests and city blocks become 10–25 m plateaus, which dominate a flat region like Mazowsze.
Road heights are solved on the road graph (densified to 10 m): each class averages the ground over its own length
(motorways 150 m … tracks 25 m), bridges are interpolated between their ends and raised 6 m over what they cross.
The ground meets the roads at runtime (a level bed within 9 m of the edge) at the three finest terrain levels.

## D5 — Tile format 3: 2048 m tiles
Data tiles are 2048 m so they line up with the terrain quadtree (64 m × 2⁵). Each carries an 8 m height grid
(uint16, 4 cm steps from −100 m), a water-level grid where there is water, a 4 m land-cover raster, roads with absolute
heights, buildings, points and POIs. Details: `docs/TILE_FORMAT.md`.

## D6 — Water from the DEM
The water surface is the DEM over mapped water, averaged over 60 m and dropped 25 cm; the bed is carved below it
(0.4 m at the shore, deepening to 3 m). Rivers slope with the land; lakes come out level. Drawn with Thornwake's water
shader (lake style for now).

## D7 — Physics: Jolt
Godot 4.7's built-in Jolt. Dead Miles' car was tuned on GodotPhysics; it is retuned here.

## D8 — Map content radius
Roads, buildings and street furniture are meshed in 128 m cells within 1 km (collision within 320 m), inside the
terrain levels whose ground follows the road beds (≥ 1,024 m). Buildings over 42 m are drawn per tile out to ~5 km
(skyline). Far roads are not drawn yet.
