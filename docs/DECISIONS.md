# Decisions

Numbered, newest last. Each says what was decided and why.

## D1 — New project from two (2026-11-12)
Baltic Drive takes the OpenStreetMap importer, tile format, road/building meshing, routing and map screen from Dead
Miles, and the world machinery (nested-LOD streaming, worker builds with frame budgets, moving origin) and water from
Thornwake. Thornwake's terrain sampler, biomes and hydrology are procedural and stay behind: the ground here is real.
Its `TileBuilder` calls that sampler directly, so the terrain tile builder is rewritten in the same layout (33×33 grid
per tile, skirts, level-0 collision in pieces) fed from map tiles.

## D2 — One projection for the whole Baltic loop
Lambert conformal conic on WGS84, standard parallels 53° and 67° N, centred 58° N 20° E
(`+proj=lcc +lat_1=53 +lat_2=67 +lat_0=58 +lon_0=20`). Scale error depends only on latitude and stays within about
±1 % from the Tatras (49° N) to North Cape (71° N), so distances and speeds are real to within a percent everywhere
and roads continue across borders with no seams. The earlier idea of a projection per tile or region would have meant
re-projecting at region edges; doubles plus the moving origin (D3) carry the 2,000+ km. Grid north differs from true
north by up to ~10° at the far east and west; `Projection.Convergence` gives the correction for the compass.

## D3 — Moving origin
World positions are doubles; the scene holds float offsets from an origin that jumps (snapped to 1,024 m) when the
focus is 2 km away. Streamed nodes are anchored (`WorldOrigin.Anchor`) and repositioned on a jump; the car warps
keeping its velocity. Shaders get `world_offset` = origin mod 65,536 m so procedural patterns stay on the ground.

## D4 — Real elevation, smoothed road profiles
Poland: GUGiK NMT (bare ground, 1 m source) resampled to 10 m through its WCS. Copernicus GLO-30 would be global but is a
surface model: forests and city blocks become 10–25 m plateaus, which dominate a flat region like Mazowsze.
Road heights are solved on the road graph (densified to 10 m): each class averages the ground over its own length
(motorways 150 m … tracks 25 m), bridges are interpolated between their ends and raised 6 m over what they cross.
The ground meets the roads at runtime (a level bed within 9 m of the edge) at the three finest terrain levels.

## D5 — Tile format 3: 2048 m tiles
Data tiles are 2048 m so they line up with the terrain quadtree (64 m × 2⁵). Each carries an 8 m height grid
(uint16, 4 cm steps from −100 m), a water-level grid where there is water, a 4 m land-cover raster, roads with absolute
heights, buildings, points and POIs. Details: `docs/TILE_FORMAT.md`.

## D6 — Water from the DEM
The water surface is the DEM over mapped water, averaged over 60 m and dropped 25 cm; the bed is carved below it
(0.4 m at the shore, deepening to 3 m). Rivers slope with the land; lakes come out level. Drawn with Thornwake's water
shader (lake style for now).

## D7 — Physics: Jolt
Godot 4.7's built-in Jolt. Dead Miles' car was tuned on GodotPhysics; it is retuned here.

## D8 — Map content radius
Roads, buildings and street furniture are meshed in 128 m cells within 1 km (collision within 320 m), inside the
terrain levels whose ground follows the road beds (≥ 1,024 m). Buildings over 42 m are drawn per tile out to ~5 km
(skyline). Far roads are not drawn yet.

## D9 — Building shader: guard the window maths
Roof faces carry no wall length or height, and the shader divided by both for every face; the NaN survived the
wall/roof mix and turned every roof black on real GPUs (Dead Miles was only ever seen on a software renderer). Both
divisors are clamped. Flat roofs are drawn at 1.5× the palette (Dead Miles' 0.8× read as tar-black here).

## D10 — Car model: Synty when installed, Quaternius otherwise
Tom's Synty Store packs are licensed for use in the game but not for redistribution, and this repository is public:
they live in `Assets/Synty/` (git-ignored) and `data/assets/synty/`. The car uses POLYGON City's sedan when it is there,
else Quaternius' CC0 pickup (committed). The car reads its wheel layout from the model (`*_Wheel_fl/fr/rl/rr` or
Quaternius' names), fits its collision boxes to the body, and strips colliders the model brings. Centre of mass
near the axles and low roll influence keep it on its wheels (the first sedan rolled over at 60 km/h).

## D11 — Junction surfaces (tile format 4)
Where three or more drivable roads meet, the importer builds one surface: junction nodes closer than their half widths
+ 8 m form one junction (dual carriageway crossings, roundabout entries), every arm is trimmed where it is clear of
the others' strips widened by a corner radius r (3–8 m by road width), and the union of the arms is closed with r —
inside corners become kerb arcs, outside corners and the straight cuts stay. Roads are cut back to the edge and carry
JunctionStart/End flags (markings stop with a stop line there); the router links road ends around each junction
(one-ways respected). The ground is shaped to the surface like to a road; elevated junctions are left alone.

## D12 — Road heights: urban smoothing, stacked decks, ramp limit
Smoothing length shrinks to 30–100 % of the class value with road density (towns follow the accurate street-level
DEM). Bridge decks clear what they cross by 6 m per level, solved in two passes so stacked levels add up (instead of
6 m × layer). Climbs up to bridges are limited to 4–6 % by lifting the approach (central Warsaw had 7 % of primary
pieces steeper than 10 %, up to 24 %).

## D13 — Elevation holes filled from GUGiK sheets
GUGiK's WCS serves only the older Kronsztadt-86 survey: 15–56 % of every Mazowsze block (21,500 km², central Warsaw
among it) came back empty and was filled with copied neighbour heights — the pits, steps and phantom viaduct ramps
Tom saw. `tools/dem/fill_gugik_sheets.py` asks the EVRF2007 sheet index which sheets cover each hole, downloads them
(ARC/INFO ASCII, preferring 1 m sheets), averages them into the 10 m blocks and deletes them: ~100+ GB of transfer,
under 3 GB kept. The datums differ by ~0.2 m in Mazowsze.

## D14 — Bridges and underground structures are not buildings
OSM maps some viaducts in 3D as building parts (man_made=bridge, bridge:structure): they stood as 5 m boxes on the
road. They are skipped (the game draws bridges from the roads), as are underground structures (location=underground,
negative layer).
